  <h1>Unsupervised Clustering of Human Tissue Transcriptomes</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project applies unsupervised machine learning to high-dimensional gene expression data to uncover natural groupings among human tissue samples.
      Using transcriptomic data from the GTEx project, the goal was to cluster tissues based solely on their RNA profiles—without any prior labels,
      to evaluate whether underlying biological identities emerge through data alone. The outcome demonstrates how machine learning can powerfully differentiate
      tissue types, identify overlaps in gene regulation, and pave the way for data-driven discoveries in functional genomics.

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Bulk RNA-Seq (TPM normalized) from ~19,000 GTEx samples and over 59,000 genes.</li>
      <li><strong>Gene Filtering:</strong> Removed low/no-expression genes, keeping ~20,500 for analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>PCA Reduction:</strong> Reduced data to 50 components while preserving ~80% of variance.</li>
      <li><strong>Unsupervised Algorithms:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>K-Means:</strong> Formed clear, distinct tissue clusters.</li>
          <li><strong>GMM:</strong> Captured overlap and soft boundaries.</li>
          <li><strong>DBSCAN:</strong> Detected dense, reliable core clusters and filtered noise.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong> Silhouette Score, Elbow Method, Davies-Bouldin Index,<br/>
        Adjusted Rand Index (0.19) and Normalized Mutual Information (0.57) validated biological alignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Cluster Insights:</strong> High purity for tissues like testis, muscle, thyroid;<br/>overlap in related tissues such as arteries and adipose tissues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pipeline Workflow</h2>

    <h3>1. Preprocessing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Filtered genes with low average expression (TPM &lt; 1).</li>
      <li>Ensured a clean, imputation-free dataset.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Dimensionality Reduction</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied PCA to compress high-dimensional gene data into principal components.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Clustering</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ran K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and DBSCAN.</li>
      <li>Tuned hyperparameters using silhouette and elbow methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Validation & Visualization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Compared cluster labels with known tissue types using confusion matrices.</li>
      <li>Used UMAP and t-SNE to visually confirm cluster separation and overlap.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This project showcases the power of unsupervised machine learning to discover biologically meaningful structures in complex genomic data.
      Even without labels, the clustering revealed clear patterns consistent with known tissue identities, highlighting the discriminatory power
      of transcriptomic profiles. The results emphasize how expression-based clustering can inform future applications in tissue classification,
      disease subtype discovery, and biomarker development, all through a data-first, hypothesis-free approach.
